# 5990_final_project
Background/Context of the Project:
The fuel poverty are becoming more and more serious in modern society.  One potential factor that may influence fuel poverty is car availability within households in Leeds. This project aims to investigate the association between fuel poverty and car availability, exploring whether households with limited car access are more likely to experience fuel poverty. we will develop a K-means clustering model to find out the this association.

What Data the GitHub Repository Contains:
A Jupyter notebook (â€œGEOG5990M_Final_Project_ipynb_.ipynb) that contains the code for data analysis and exploration.

A README file (README.md) providing an overview of the project, instructions for running the code, and any other relevant information.

Dataset: There are three dataset will contain in this project consists of two non-spatail dataset and one spatial dataset, which are fuel poverty by LSOA, Car or van availablity and Lower Super Output Area (LSOA) with geometry.

What the Code Aims to Do:

The code read in the dataset into the program and do some data cleaning and explory 

Join the non-spatial data into spatial data, and calculate the proportion of the car availability per households

Apply K-means clustering as statistic model to explore the relationship between fuel poverty and car availability

Generate the final two visualization (one spatial and one non-spatial) to explore the association
